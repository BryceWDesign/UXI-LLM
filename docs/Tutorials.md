   - Install dependencies (Python 3.9+, PyTorch, etc.)  
   - Prepare datasets in `/data/` folder (see data format examples)

2. **Training**  
   - Run training via CLI:

     python scripts/train_from_cli.py --config configs/default.json
     ```  
   - Monitor training logs for progress and checkpoints.

3. **Inference**  
   - Use `scripts/run_inference.py` to generate predictions:  
     ```bash
     python scripts/run_inference.py "Your input text here"
     ```

## Advanced Topics

- Fine-tuning with local datasets  
- Extending tokenizer and adding new vocab  
- Integrating symbolic reasoning modules
