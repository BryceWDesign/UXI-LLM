# Fine-Tuning Specification

## Overview

UXI-LLM supports fine-tuning at multiple granularities, enabling local, remote, or hybrid training on user-provided datasets. Designed for extensibility and ease-of-use to adapt models rapidly.

## Key Features

- 🧠 Supports full and partial model fine-tuning (adapter layers, LoRA, etc.)
- 🛠️ Configurable training loops with customizable loss functions
- 📦 Dataset ingestion supports text, symbolic logic, and structured data
- 💾 Checkpointing and resume capabilities
- 🔄 Hot-reload of fine-tuned modules without full restart

## Training Modes

| Mode           | Description                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Local          | On-device training for privacy and control  |
| Remote         | Cloud-accelerated training via API           |
| Hybrid         | Distributed training mixing local and remote|

## API Example (Python)

```python
from uxi import FineTuner

tuner = FineTuner(model="uxi-transformer-v1")
tuner.load_dataset("my_custom_data.jsonl")
tuner.train(epochs=3, batch_size=16)
tuner.save_checkpoint("checkpoint_v1.pt")
