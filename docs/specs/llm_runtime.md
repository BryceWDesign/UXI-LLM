# LLM Runtime Specification

## Purpose

The runtime powers the execution of UXI-LLM models, managing model loading, memory, inference control, symbolic hooks, and hardware acceleration. It is modular, embeddable, and designed for both server and edge environments.

---

## Core Responsibilities

- 📦 Load and validate model weights
- 🧠 Run inference across backends (PyTorch, ONNX, etc.)
- 🧩 Inject symbolic reasoning units dynamically
- 🔌 Interface with I/O layers, APIs, and pipelines
- ⚙️ Support quantization, batching, caching, and streaming

---

## Runtime Layers

| Layer         | Role                                      |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Loader        | Parses model and tokenizer artifacts      |
| Executor      | Handles inference logic                   |
| Memory        | Allocates GPU/CPU buffers efficiently     |
| Middleware    | Binds hooks: logging, metrics, symbols    |
| Router        | Dispatches between backend engines        |

---

## Supported Modes

- ☁️ Server (multi-client, high throughput)
- 🖥️ Desktop (local usage and debugging)
- 🧠 Embedded (microcontroller or low-memory runtime via WASM, etc.)
- 🔁 Streaming (live decoding and reinforcement)

---

## Future Goals

- Fine-grained execution graph introspection
- Auto-batching with adaptive latency/throughput tradeoffs
- Full hybrid symbolic/neural execution pathway (in-progress)
