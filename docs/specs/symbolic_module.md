# Symbolic Module Specification

## Purpose

The symbolic module is designed to augment the LLM with interpretable, deterministic, logic-based reasoning capabilities. It operates in tandem with neural layers, or independently when symbol-only paths are requested.

---

## Design Goals

- 🔗 Seamless integration with LLM token stream
- 🧠 Modular logic graphs that handle inference or verify model outputs
- 🧩 Compatible with external knowledge bases and rule engines
- 🔁 Runtime-switchable symbolic/semantic hybrid mode

---

## Architecture Overview

1. Parser: Translates token streams into logic nodes
2. Resolver: Matches patterns against internal or external rules
3. Evaluator: Performs computation or proves logical consistency
4. Bridge: Hooks into LLM inference layer to augment or overwrite outputs

---

## Example Use Case

```python
user_input = "If A implies B, and A is true, what is B?"
logic_graph = symbolic.parse(user_input)
assert logic_graph.evaluate() == "B is true"
