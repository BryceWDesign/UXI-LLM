# Tokenizer Specification

## Overview

The UXI-LLM tokenizer is modular, language-agnostic, and supports byte-pair encoding (BPE) with symbol-preserving enhancements for symbolic reasoning. It is designed to be interchangeable and configurable at runtime.

---

## Features

- üî§ Supports subword tokenization via standard BPE
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable vocabulary size, reserved tokens, and pre-tokenization filters
- üß† Symbol-preserving: respects mathematical, logical, and structured syntax
- üß© Plug-and-play: multiple tokenizer backends (e.g., HuggingFace, custom)
- üí° Dynamic vocabulary injection during runtime

## Reserved Tokens

| Token         | Meaning                     |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| `<PAD>`       | Padding                     |
| `<UNK>`       | Unknown token               |
| `<BOS>`       | Beginning of sequence       |
| `<EOS>`       | End of sequence             |
| `<SYMBOL>`    | Symbolic identifier prefix  |

## Configuration Example

```json
{
  "tokenizer_type": "bpe",
  "vocab_size": 50257,
  "lowercase": false,
  "preserve_symbols": true,
  "reserved_tokens": ["<PAD>", "<UNK>", "<BOS>", "<EOS>", "<SYMBOL>"]
}
