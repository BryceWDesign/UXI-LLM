# UXI-LLM Project Overview

UXI-LLM is a modular, symbolic-ready large language model framework designed to address key developer pain points such as local fine-tuning, full language interoperability, and composable reasoning.  
The project aims to provide extensible tools for building, training, and deploying advanced LLMs with strong integration capabilities across diverse AI ecosystems.

## Goals
- Enable local model fine-tuning and adaptation  
- Support symbolic reasoning integrated with neural methods  
- Provide seamless interoperability with multiple programming languages and AI frameworks  
- Facilitate modularity and composability in model components

## Architecture
UXI-LLM is structured into components:
- Core model implementation (Transformer-based)  
- Data preprocessing and tokenization utilities  
- Training and evaluation scripts  
- Integration layers for external APIs and languages
