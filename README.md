# UXI-LLM

> A next-generation, modular, symbolic + neural hybrid large language model built to solve modern AI's biggest pain points.

## 🔥 Key Features

- 🧠 **Hybrid AI Core**: Integrates neural transformers with symbolic reasoning.
- 🧩 **True Modularity**: Swap or extend any model component (tokenizer, attention, reasoning).
- 🖥️ **Fully Local Compatible**: Train and run offline on local machines.
- 🔌 **Plugin System**: Extend capabilities with hot-swappable modules.
- 📡 **API Ready**: Full REST, WebSocket, and CLI interfaces.
- 📊 **Evaluation Tools**: Benchmarks, logic tests, and memory diagnostics included.

## 🚀 Why UXI-LLM?

Modern LLMs are huge, closed, cloud-dependent, and rigid. UXI-LLM is the opposite:
- Local-first, open, and customizable.
- Built for hackers, researchers, and devs who want control.
- Designed to evolve with the community.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch (for neural layers)
- SymPy / Z3 / MiniKanren (for symbolic logic)
- FastAPI (for API layer)
- YAML (for modular configs)
- Docker (for CI/infra)

## 📂 Project Layout (Preview)

```
/core         - neural model code
/symbolic     - rule engine, logic DSL
/plugins      - custom extensions
/api          - FastAPI + CLI tools
/configs      - YAML config files
/tests        - unit + integration tests
/docs         - Markdown docs + architecture
```

## 🧠 Symbolic Reasoning Capabilities

UXI-LLM can:
- Apply user-defined logic rules to guide generations
- Mix symbolic + statistical inference at runtime
- Embed reasoning modules inside transformer attention

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
# Requirements
Python 3.10+
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛠️ Development Status

Currently in heavy development. MVP will support:
- Training on small local datasets
- Interoperable plugin injection
- Symbolic parsing + attention hooks
